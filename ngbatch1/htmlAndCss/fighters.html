<h1>fighters of india</h1>
<p>Hundreds and thousands left everything, and many sacrificed their life for one common goal - freedom of India from foreign rule! These freedom fighters, activists and revolutionaries came from different backgrounds and philosophies to fight one common enemy - the foreign imperialists! While we are aware of several freedom fighters and revolutionaries, many have remained unsung heroes. We have made best efforts to present some of the most prominent freedom activists and revolutionaries who made immense contribution towards India’s struggle for freedom.</p>
